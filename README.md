# Reproccer Evolved
Reproccer Reborn, rewritten on C# with Mutagen, to be used with Synthesis patching framework.

WIP, ***currently only armor and weapons patchers are available***. While both are fully functional, the release is for testing purposes for now.

# Installation
* Download and install [Synthesis](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis/releases)
